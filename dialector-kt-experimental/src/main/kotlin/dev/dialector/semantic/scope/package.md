Scoping:

1) Contextual scoping
    Derived from the local AST structure.
2) Global scoping
    Provided by the overall program model.

Other scoping?
    - Typed scoping
        Is this just a form of Contextual scoping?
    - Visibility
        This is likely a language-specific concept
    - Hiding
        Can be represented using composition, no need to be explicit
